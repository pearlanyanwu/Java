Hi! Welcome to my profile! I was introduced to Java @ SF State in Fall 2021. These are the projects I've contributed to during that semester.

All projects written on IntelliJ Idea. ( Java IDE )

Note: All projects were pre-coded by my professor.
I will mark the beginning and ending of my contribuctions at the top of the code for each project.
